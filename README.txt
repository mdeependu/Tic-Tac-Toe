INTRODUCTION:
Tic Tac Toe is a basic board game which is played using “X” and “O”. In this game the player has 
to make a continuous combination of three “X” s or “O” s. The player can either make the combination
row wise, column wise or diagonal wise. This game has been made using Python language. 

DEFINITION:
I have made this game by defining different functions. In my game the first move is for “X”. 

1 | 2 | 3
----------
4 | 5 | 6
----------
7 | 8 | 9

This is the format of the board of my game.
In order to make a move one has to enter the number of the position he/she wants to put “X” or “O”
After “X” makes a move the next move becomes for “O”.
